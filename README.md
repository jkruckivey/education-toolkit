### ✨ NEW: Evidence-Based Assessment Methodologies

#### PAIRR (Peer and AI Review + Reflection)
**Research-backed dual-feedback methodology** where students receive feedback from both a peer and AI, then critically compare both sources through structured reflection.

**Benefits:**
- Develops critical AI literacy (students evaluate AI output quality)
- Multiple perspectives improve writing quality
- Students maintain writerly agency (choose which feedback to apply)
- Prepares for AI-integrated workplaces

**Implementation:**
1. Student submits 80% draft
2. Gets peer review (rubric-aligned) + AI feedback (same rubric)
3. Completes comparative reflection (150-200 words)
4. Revises based on critical evaluation
5. Post-revision reflection on which feedback influenced most

**Ask agents:** "Design a PAIRR workflow for my reflection memo" or "Generate a PAIRR rubric with bonus points"

#### AI Roleplay Exercises
**Conversational assessments** where students engage with AI character roleplaying as stakeholder, expert, or decision-maker.

**Three Types:**
1. **Diagnostic** (pre-learning): Reveals gaps before content delivery
2. **Formative** (during learning): Practice before summative assessment
3. **Summative** (after learning): Demonstrates mastery through conversation

**Benefits:**
- Tests application & synthesis (higher Bloom's levels)
- Authentic communication practice
- Immediate conversational feedback
- Accessibility: Oral assessment alternative

**Ask agents:** "Design an AI Roleplay for practicing [skill]" or "Create a diagnostic roleplay exercise"

#### Diagnostic Rubrics (3-Level)
**Formative pre-learning rubrics** with Beginning → Developing → Proficient levels (no "Exemplary" since mastery not expected).

**Key Features:**
- Typical student responses at each level
- Support flags (when to provide scaffolding)
- Non-evaluative tone ("This helps you identify what to focus on")
- 2-3 minute grading time per student

**Ask agents:** "Generate a diagnostic rubric for pre-assessment" or "Create a 3-level formative rubric"

### 🚀 NEW: Executable Skills (Python Automation)

**Agents now invoke executable Python skills for automated template generation and validation.**

#### assessment-template-generator
**Automated PAIRR, AI Roleplay, and Diagnostic Rubric generation**
- Generates complete PAIRR assignment templates (rubric + AI prompt + reflections + faculty guide)
- Creates Uplimit AI Roleplay configurations (diagnostic/formative/summative types)
- Builds 3-level diagnostic rubrics with support flags
- **Agents invoke automatically** when you request these assessment types

**Example**: "Create a PAIRR assignment for my marketing memo" → Agent runs Python script → Complete template generated

#### accessibility-audit-tools
**Automated WCAG 2.2 AA compliance checking**
- Color contrast validator (calculates ratios, suggests fix colors)
- Alt text checker (presence + quality patterns)
- Heading hierarchy validator
- ARIA compliance scanner
- **Agents invoke for first-pass automation**, then manual review

**Example**: "Check accessibility compliance" → Agent runs automated tests → Detailed report with line numbers and fixes

#### qm-validator
**Quality Matters standards validation**
- Outcome-criteria alignment checker (detects orphaned criteria)
- Rubric math validator (point totals, distribution balance)
- Measurable language analyzer (Bloom's taxonomy verbs)
- **Agents invoke proactively** after generating rubrics

**Example**: Agent generates rubric → Auto-validates QM compliance → Fixes issues before presenting to you

**Why Skills Matter**: These executable tools save 10-15 minutes per assessment by automating repetitive structure generation and validation, letting agents focus on customization and design advice.

**Distribution Options:**
- **Bundled** (default): Skills included with plugin, zero config
- **Standalone**: Download ZIPs from [releases](https://github.com/jkruckivey/education-toolkit/releases) for use with other plugins

📖 **[Skills Installation Guide](SKILLS-INSTALLATION.md)** - Detailed setup instructions, requirements, and troubleshooting

### 🔄 NEW: Automatic Quality Enforcement (Hooks)

**Built-in automation that runs quality checks automatically - zero API tokens, zero manual effort.**

This plugin includes 5 automatic hooks that enforce quality standards in real-time:

#### Hook 1: Smart Content Validator (PostToolUse)
**Runs after every file edit** - Instant feedback on quality issues

✓ **HTML files**: WCAG 2.2 AA checks (contrast, alt text, headings, buttons, tables)
✓ **Markdown files**: Learning outcomes (Bloom's verbs), rubric math, PAIRR components, WCAG version
✓ **Storyboards**: Colored emoji detection, terminology consistency

**Example output:**
```
📋 Auto-validation found 2 issue(s):
  ⚠️  Found 3 instance(s) of vague learning outcome language
     Avoid: understand, know, learn about
     Use: explain, identify, analyze, evaluate

  ⚠️  Missing alt text on 1 image(s)
     All images need alt="description" or alt="" (if decorative)
```

**Token savings**: ~10,000 tokens per validation × 20 edits/day = 200,000 tokens/day saved

#### Hook 2: Educational Context Loader (SessionStart)
**Runs once at session start** - Sets educational standards context automatically

✓ Loads WCAG 2.2 AA, QM 6th Edition, Bloom's Taxonomy, UDL standards
✓ Displays available quick commands (/design-assessment, /peer-review, etc.)
✓ Shows course-specific config (if `.education-toolkit-config.json` exists)
✓ Reminds you of automatic quality checks active

**No more forgetting** which WCAG version to use or which commands are available.

#### Hook 3: Protected Content Guardian (PreToolUse)
**Runs before editing published content** - Prevents accidental changes to student-facing materials

✓ Blocks edits to `published/`, `production/`, `final/`, `student-facing/`, `graded/` paths
✓ Shows warning with risks (fairness, academic integrity, student trust)
✓ Recommends creating draft version first
✓ Requires explicit approval to proceed

**Protects against**: Changing rubrics after students submit, modifying published assessments mid-term

#### Hook 4: Storyboard Auto-Formatter (PostToolUse)
**Runs after editing storyboards** - Ensures consistent platform conventions

✓ Converts colored emoji → black symbols (🔴→⬤ 🟡→◐ 🟢→○)
✓ Standardizes priority badges, element headings, MLO references
✓ Fixes table spacing, heading spacing, time estimates
✓ Removes trailing spaces, normalizes blank lines

**Example output:**
```
✨ Auto-formatted storyboard:
  • Converted 8× 🔴 → ⬤
  • Converted 5× 📺 → ▶
  • Standardized element heading format (dash → colon)
  • Fixed table spacing
```

#### Hook 5: Fullstack Code Reviewer (PostToolUse)
**Runs after editing Python or React code** - Automatic code review for educational technology projects

✓ **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: Security, input validation, error handling, API design, async/await
✓ **Frontend (React/JSX)**: Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), state management, UX patterns, performance
✓ **Smart routing**: Detects file type → launches specialized agent (backend-reviewer or frontend-reviewer)
✓ **Skips non-code**: Config files, package.json, small formatting changes

**Review criteria:**
- **Security**: Authentication, input sanitization, secret management
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- **Best practices**: React hooks, error handling, loading states, user feedback
- **Performance**: Database queries, re-renders, bundle size

**Example output:**
```
📝 Frontend Review: App.jsx:236-267

✅ STRENGTHS:
  • Line 236-248: Excellent assessment-result pattern
  • Line 245-246: Smart use of _next_content to preload

⚠️ SUGGESTIONS:
  • Line 194-206: getCalibrationMessage could be memoized
  • Line 249: Consider functional update: setContentIndex(i => i + 1)

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:
  • None found
```

**When to use manually**: Invoke `backend-reviewer` or `frontend-reviewer` agents directly for comprehensive file review without waiting for edits
