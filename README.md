### âœ¨ NEW: Evidence-Based Assessment Methodologies

#### PAIRR (Peer and AI Review + Reflection)
**Research-backed dual-feedback methodology** where students receive feedback from both a peer and AI, then critically compare both sources through structured reflection.

**Benefits:**
- Develops critical AI literacy (students evaluate AI output quality)
- Multiple perspectives improve writing quality
- Students maintain writerly agency (choose which feedback to apply)
- Prepares for AI-integrated workplaces

**Implementation:**
1. Student submits 80% draft
2. Gets peer review (rubric-aligned) + AI feedback (same rubric)
3. Completes comparative reflection (150-200 words)
4. Revises based on critical evaluation
5. Post-revision reflection on which feedback influenced most

**Ask agents:** "Design a PAIRR workflow for my reflection memo" or "Generate a PAIRR rubric with bonus points"

#### AI Roleplay Exercises
**Conversational assessments** where students engage with AI character roleplaying as stakeholder, expert, or decision-maker.

**Three Types:**
1. **Diagnostic** (pre-learning): Reveals gaps before content delivery
2. **Formative** (during learning): Practice before summative assessment
3. **Summative** (after learning): Demonstrates mastery through conversation

**Benefits:**
- Tests application & synthesis (higher Bloom's levels)
- Authentic communication practice
- Immediate conversational feedback
- Accessibility: Oral assessment alternative

**Ask agents:** "Design an AI Roleplay for practicing [skill]" or "Create a diagnostic roleplay exercise"

#### Diagnostic Rubrics (3-Level)
**Formative pre-learning rubrics** with Beginning â†’ Developing â†’ Proficient levels (no "Exemplary" since mastery not expected).

**Key Features:**
- Typical student responses at each level
- Support flags (when to provide scaffolding)
- Non-evaluative tone ("This helps you identify what to focus on")
- 2-3 minute grading time per student

**Ask agents:** "Generate a diagnostic rubric for pre-assessment" or "Create a 3-level formative rubric"
