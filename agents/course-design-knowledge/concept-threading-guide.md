# Concept Threading Guide
## Building Cohesive Course Narratives Through Intentional Concept Repetition

**Purpose**: Ensure concepts introduced early in the course are revisited, built upon, and integrated in later weeks to create a cohesive learning narrative.

**Problem Solved**: "Orphaned concepts" - topics taught once in Week 1 that never reappear, leaving students with fragmented knowledge instead of integrated understanding.

## What is Concept Threading?

**Concept Threading** is the intentional practice of introducing key concepts/frameworks in Week 1 and systematically revisiting, applying, and building upon them in subsequent weeks.

### Thread vs. Topic

❌ **Topic** (one-and-done):
```
Week 1: Cover Topic A
Week 2: Cover Topic B (no mention of Topic A)
Week 3: Cover Topic C (no mention of Topics A or B)
```
**Result**: Fragmented knowledge, students forget Week 1 by Week 3

✅ **Thread** (integrated):
```
Week 1: Introduce Framework X
Week 2: Apply Framework X to new context, add Layer 2
Week 3: Apply Framework X + Layer 2 to complex scenario
Week 4: Synthesize Framework X + other tools
```
**Result**: Deep understanding, students master Framework X through repeated application

---

## Why Threading Matters

### Cognitive Benefits
1. **Spaced Repetition**: Revisiting concepts over time improves long-term retention
2. **Transfer of Learning**: Applying concepts in new contexts deepens understanding
3. **Integration**: Students see how concepts connect rather than isolated facts
4. **Mastery**: Multiple exposures build fluency and confidence

### Pedagogical Benefits
1. **Coherent Narrative**: Course feels like a unified story, not disconnected modules
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Students reuse prior knowledge instead of constantly learning new vocabulary
3. **Explicit Scaffolding**: "Remember from Week 1..." makes connections visible
4. **Authentic Assessment**: Final projects naturally integrate all threads

### Student Experience Benefits
1. **Confidence**: "I recognize this concept from Week 1 - I can do this!"
2. **Meaning-Making**: Students understand WHY they learned something in Week 1
3. **Retention**: Concepts revisited 3-5 times are remembered long after the course ends

## Threading Patterns

### Pattern 1: Foundation → Application → Synthesis

**Structure**:
```
Week 1: Introduce CORE FRAMEWORK (foundational)
Week 2: Apply CORE FRAMEWORK to DOMAIN 1 (application)
Week 3: Apply CORE FRAMEWORK to DOMAIN 2 (application)
Week 4: Synthesize CORE FRAMEWORK across domains (integration)
Week 5: Capstone requiring CORE FRAMEWORK (mastery)
```

**Example**:
```
Week 1: Introduce "Revenue Ecosystem Framework" (5 interdependent streams)
Week 2: Apply framework to media rights (largest stream)
Week 3: Apply framework to sponsorship (integration with media)
Week 4: Apply framework to stakeholder branding (revenue generation)
Week 5: Final project requires full ecosystem analysis
```

**When to Use**: When course has 1 central framework/model

---

### Pattern 2: Progressive Layering

**Structure**:
```
Week 1: Introduce LAYER 1 (simple)
Week 2: Add LAYER 2 (moderate complexity)
Week 3: Add LAYER 3 (advanced)
Week 4: Apply all 3 layers to complex scenario
Week 5: Students create their own layered analysis
```

**Example**:
```
Week 1: Financial analysis (revenue, costs, profit)
Week 2: Add strategic positioning (competitive advantage)
Week 3: Add cultural factors (organizational readiness)
Week 4: Analyze case using all 3 lenses (financial + strategic + cultural)
Week 5: Final project requires integrated analysis
```

**When to Use**: When course builds complexity progressively

---

### Pattern 3: Spiral Curriculum

**Structure**:
```
Week 1: Introduce CONCEPT at basic level
Week 2: Revisit CONCEPT with added complexity
Week 3: Revisit CONCEPT with advanced application
Week 4: Revisit CONCEPT with critical evaluation
Week 5: Capstone demonstrates mastery
```

**Example**:
```
Week 1: Define "innovation" (types: incremental, radical, disruptive)
Week 2: Analyze innovation in specific industry (apply definitions)
Week 3: Evaluate innovation success factors (critical thinking)
Week 4: Design innovation process (synthesis)
Week 5: Innovation strategy for real organization (creation)
```

**When to Use**: When concept appears simple but has deep implications

---

### Pattern 4: Tool Accumulation

**Structure**:
```
Week 1: Introduce TOOL 1
Week 2: Introduce TOOL 2, use TOOL 1 + TOOL 2 together
Week 3: Introduce TOOL 3, use TOOL 1 + TOOL 2 + TOOL 3 together
Week 4: Students select appropriate tools for scenario
Week 5: Students apply all tools to capstone project
```

**Example**:
```
Week 1: SWOT Analysis
Week 2: Porter's Five Forces + revisit SWOT
Week 3: PESTEL Analysis + revisit SWOT + Five Forces
Week 4: Case requires selecting appropriate tool(s)
Week 5: Final project uses all 3 frameworks
```

**When to Use**: When course teaches multiple frameworks/tools

---

## How to Thread Concepts

### Step 1: Identify Core Concepts (During Outline Phase)

Ask: **What are the 3-5 concepts students MUST master?**

**Example** (from 5-week course):
1. Revenue Ecosystem Framework
2. Media Economics (traditional vs streaming)
3. ROI Measurement
4. Stakeholder Branding
5. Innovation vs Tradition

---

### Step 2: Introduce in Week 1

**Make Week 1 foundational**:
- Introduce core framework/vocabulary
- Provide clear definition and examples
- Use simple application (no complexity yet)
- Test understanding with formative assessment

**Example**: Week 1 introduces "Revenue Ecosystem Framework" with 5 streams, students map basic ecosystem

---

### Step 3: Apply in Weeks 2-4

**Each subsequent week**:
- **Explicit callback**: "Recall from Week 1, the Revenue Ecosystem Framework..."
- **New context**: Apply same framework to different domain/scenario
- **Added complexity**: Introduce nuances, trade-offs, edge cases
- **Integration**: Show how this week's topic connects to prior weeks

**Example**:
- Week 2: "Using the Revenue Ecosystem Framework from Week 1, analyze how media rights (the largest stream) interact with other streams"
- Week 3: "Apply the Revenue Ecosystem Framework to evaluate sponsorship ROI - which streams does sponsorship amplify?"

---

### Step 4: Synthesize in Week 5

**Capstone integration**:
- Require students to use ALL core concepts
- Assess ability to select appropriate tools for new scenarios
- Test transfer: Can students apply frameworks to unfamiliar context?

**Example**: Final project requires revenue ecosystem analysis, media positioning, sponsorship strategy, and stakeholder branding - all integrated

---

### Step 5: Make Threads Explicit

**Use scaffolding language**:
- "Recall from Week 1..."
- "Building on last week's analysis..."
- "Now that we've seen Framework X in Context A, let's apply it to Context B"
- "This week integrates Concepts 1, 2, and 3 from prior weeks"

**Visual threading**:
- Week 5 includes "Concept Map" widget showing all connections
- Final project rubric explicitly lists which weeks' concepts are required
- Assessment instructions reference specific prior weeks

---

## Common Threading Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Orphaned Concepts

❌ **Problem**:
```
Week 1: Introduces Framework X
Week 2-5: Never mentions Framework X again
```

✅ **Fix**:
```
Week 1: Introduces Framework X
Week 2: Applies Framework X to Case Study 1
Week 3: Applies Framework X to Case Study 2
Week 4: Synthesizes Framework X with other tools
Week 5: Final project requires Framework X
```

---

### Mistake 2: Too Many New Concepts Each Week

❌ **Problem**:
```
Week 1: 5 new frameworks
Week 2: 5 different new frameworks
Week 3: 5 more new frameworks
Result: 15 frameworks, students master none
```

✅ **Fix**:
```
Week 1: 3 core frameworks (A, B, C)
Week 2: Apply A, B, C + add nuance
Week 3: Apply A, B, C + integrate
Week 4: Master A, B, C through synthesis
Week 5: Demonstrate mastery in capstone
Result: 3 frameworks, students master all
```

**Rule of Thumb**: Introduce ≤3 core frameworks, revisit 3+ times each

---

### Mistake 3: Implicit Threading

❌ **Problem**:
Students don't realize Week 3 builds on Week 1 (no explicit callback)

✅ **Fix**:
- Explicitly state: "Recall the Revenue Ecosystem Framework from Week 1"
- Visual cues: Week 3 diagram shows Week 1 framework + new layer
- Assessment instructions: "Use Week 1 framework to analyze Week 3 case"

**Why**: Students don't automatically connect concepts - make connections explicit

---

### Mistake 4: Linear Topics Instead of Threaded Concepts

❌ **Linear (topics)**:
```
Week 1: History of the industry
Week 2: Current industry structure
Week 3: Future trends
```
**Problem**: Chronological but no threads

✅ **Threaded (concepts)**:
```
Week 1: Business model analysis framework
Week 2: Apply framework to current industry (build on Week 1)
Week 3: Apply framework to predict future changes (build on Weeks 1-2)
```
**Solution**: Organize by concepts that thread, not chronology

---

### Mistake 5: Assessment Misalignment

❌ **Problem**:
```
Weeks 1-4: Focus on Framework X extensively
Week 5 Final: Doesn't mention or require Framework X
```

✅ **Fix**:
```
Weeks 1-4: Build mastery of Framework X
Week 5 Final: Explicitly requires Framework X application
Rubric: "Demonstrates mastery of Framework X (25 points)"
```

**Principle**: Assess what you thread

## Threading Checklist

Use this checklist when designing course outlines:

### Planning Phase

- [ ] Identify 3-5 core concepts/frameworks for entire course
- [ ] Ensure Week 1 introduces all core concepts (at least at basic level)
- [ ] Map where each concept reappears in Weeks 2-5 (minimum 3 appearances per concept)
- [ ] Check that final assessment requires ALL core concepts

### Week-by-Week Design

- [ ] Week 1: Foundational introduction of core concepts
- [ ] Week 2: Applies ≥1 Week 1 concept to new context
- [ ] Week 3: Applies ≥2 prior concepts (from Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Week 4: Synthesizes ≥3 prior concepts (from Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] Week 5: Integrates ALL prior concepts in capstone

### Language & Scaffolding

- [ ] Each week explicitly references prior week concepts ("Recall from Week X...")
- [ ] Visual aids show concept connections (diagrams, concept maps)
- [ ] Assessment instructions specify which weeks' concepts are required

### Assessment Alignment

- [ ] Week 1 formative assessment tests core concept understanding
- [ ] Weeks 2-4 assessments require applying prior concepts
- [ ] Week 5 final explicitly lists all core concepts in rubric
- [ ] No "orphaned concepts" (concepts taught but never assessed again)

### Quality Check

- [ ] Read Weeks 1-5 in sequence - does the narrative flow?
- [ ] Could you draw a concept map showing all connections?
- [ ] If Week 1 were removed, would Weeks 2-5 make sense? (Answer should be NO)
- [ ] Final project impossible without mastering Week 1-4 concepts? (Answer should be YES)

## Examples

### Example 1: Strong Threading (Revenue Ecosystem Course)

**Core Concept**: Revenue Ecosystem Framework (5 interdependent streams)

| Week | How Concept Appears | Complexity |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Introduced: Map 5 revenue streams, understand interdependencies | Basic |
| 2 | Applied: Analyze media rights stream using full ecosystem lens | Moderate |
| 3 | Applied: Evaluate sponsorship ROI considering ecosystem effects | Moderate |
| 4 | Synthesized: Stakeholder branding leverages multiple ecosystem streams | Advanced |
| 5 | Mastered: Final project requires full ecosystem analysis for new property | Mastery |

**Evidence of Threading**:
- Concept appears 5 times (all weeks)
- Complexity increases each week
- Week 5 impossible without Week 1 mastery
- Explicit callbacks in Weeks 2-5

---

### Example 2: Weak Threading (Orphaned Concepts)

**Concept**: SWOT Analysis

| Week | How Concept Appears | Problem |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | Introduced: Define SWOT, practice on simple company | ✅ Good start |
| 2 | Not mentioned | ❌ Orphaned |
| 3 | Not mentioned | ❌ Orphaned |
| 4 | Not mentioned | ❌ Orphaned |
| 5 | Final project doesn't require SWOT | ❌ Wasted Week 1 time |

**Fix**:
- Week 2: Apply SWOT to Case Study 1
- Week 3: Use SWOT + Porter's Five Forces (integration)
- Week 4: Students select SWOT or other tool based on scenario
- Week 5: Final project requires SWOT analysis section

---

### Example 3: Progressive Layering (Innovation Course)

**Core Concept**: Innovation Types (Disruptive, Sustaining, Architectural)

| Week | Layer | How It Builds |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | **Layer 1**: Define 3 innovation types | Foundation |
| 2 | **Layer 2**: Add resource allocation (how much to invest in each type) | Moderate |
| 3 | **Layer 3**: Add cultural enablers (what culture supports each type) | Advanced |
| 4 | **Integration**: Case requires analyzing all 3 types + resources + culture | Synthesis |
| 5 | **Creation**: Students design innovation portfolio for real organization | Mastery |

**Evidence of Layering**:
- Base concept (innovation types) present in all weeks
- Each week adds complexity without replacing foundation
- Week 5 requires all layers integrated

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Name Your Threads

Give core concepts memorable names that you repeat across weeks:
- "Revenue Ecosystem Framework"
- "Three-Tier AI Use Model"
- "PAIRR Methodology"

**Why**: Students remember named frameworks better than generic "concepts"

---

### 2. Use Visual Thread Maps

Include a "Concept Map" in Week 5 showing all thread connections:
```
Week 1 Framework
   ↓
Week 2 Application (Domain A)
   ↓
Week 3 Application (Domain B) + Week 2 Integration
   ↓
Week 4 Synthesis
   ↓
Week 5 Capstone
```

**Why**: Makes threading explicit and visible

---

### 3. Limit Core Threads

**Rule**: 3-5 core threads maximum for 5-week course

**Rationale**:
- ≤2 threads = Not enough depth
- 3-5 threads = Mastery achievable
- ≥6 threads = Cognitive overload

**Calculation**: If each thread appears 5 times (once per week) and you have 4 threads, that's 20 concept appearances - manageable. With 10 threads x 5 appearances = 50 - overwhelming.

---

### 4. Test Threading Before Building

**Quick Test**:
1. List your 3-5 core concepts
2. For each concept, mark which weeks it appears
3. If any concept appears <3 times → either add appearances or cut concept
4. If Week 5 doesn't require ALL concepts → fix final assessment

**Example**:
```
Concept A: Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ✅ (appears 5 times)
Concept B: Weeks 1, 3, 5 ✅ (appears 3 times - minimum)
Concept C: Week 1 only ❌ (orphaned - fix or cut)
```
