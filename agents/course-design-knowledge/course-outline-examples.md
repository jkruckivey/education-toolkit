## Key Patterns to Replicate

### 1. CLO Design (from both examples)

✅ **DO**:
- Use **single action verbs** (Analyze, Evaluate, Design, Create)
- Provide **context** (what domain, with what tools)
- Write **observable outcomes** (what students will DO, not "know")
- Align **Bloom's level** with course level (Apply/Analyze for professional, Evaluate/Create for graduate)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use compound verbs ("understand and apply")
- Use vague verbs ("appreciate", "be familiar with")
- Write only knowledge outcomes for graduate courses
- Skip Bloom's level identification

---

### 2. MLO → CLO Laddering (from Example 1)

**Pattern**: Each week's MLOs support 1 primary CLO

**Example**:
```
CLO 1: Analyze Revenue Ecosystems

Week 1 MLOs:
- MLO 1.1: Map revenue streams (foundational)
- MLO 1.2: Explain business model differences (comprehension)
- MLO 1.3: Evaluate vulnerabilities and growth potential (analysis)
- MLO 1.4: Analyze revenue sharing models (synthesis)

Result: MLOs 1.1-1.4 together = mastery of CLO 1
```

**Numbering Convention**:
- MLO [Week].[Outcome]
- Example: MLO 2.3 = Week 2, Outcome 3

---

### 3. Assessment Scaffolding (from both examples)

**Cohort Pattern** (Example 1):
```
Week 1: Formative (10%) - Low stakes, build confidence
Week 2: Formative (15%) - Apply frameworks
Week 3: Collaborative (15%) - Group work, peer learning
Week 4: Peer-Scaffolded (20%) - PAIRR methodology
Week 5: Summative (40%) - Capstone integration
```

**Self-Paced Pattern** (Example 2):
```
Module 1: Checkpoint (formative, ungraded progression gate)
Module 2: Checkpoint (formative, ungraded progression gate)
Module 3: Checkpoint (formative, ungraded progression gate)
Final: Summative (100% of grade, but all checkpoints ensure readiness)
```

**Key Insight**: Scaffolding ≠ weights. Self-paced can be 100% final assessment if checkpoints ensure mastery.

---

### 4. Concept Threading (from Example 1)

**Template**:
```
Week 1: Introduce CORE FRAMEWORK
  ↓
Week 2: Apply CORE FRAMEWORK to DOMAIN 1
  ↓
Week 3: Apply CORE FRAMEWORK to DOMAIN 2, integrate with Week 2
  ↓
Week 4: Synthesize Weeks 1-3 for ADVANCED APPLICATION
  ↓
Week 5: Capstone requiring ALL CONCEPTS
```

**Anti-Pattern**:
```
Week 1: Topic A
Week 2: Unrelated Topic B
Week 3: Unrelated Topic C
Week 4: Unrelated Topic D
Week 5: Pick any topic for final project
```

**Result**: Orphaned concepts with no integration

---

### 5. Case Study Integration (from both examples)

**Cohort Courses**:
- 1 case per week (5 total for 5-week course)
- Cases scaffold in complexity: Week 1 (straightforward), Week 5 (ambiguous)
- Cases tie directly to MLOs: "Analyze revenue sharing" → Case shows revenue sharing in action

**Self-Paced Courses**:
- 1 major case per 2-3 modules
- Cases with AI-supported discussion (ABIEL chatbot)
- Auto-graded case questions for immediate feedback

---

### 6. UDL Across Formats (from both examples)

**Representation**:
- Text (readings, memos)
- Visual (diagrams, widgets)
- Auditory (videos, podcasts)
- Interactive (simulations, calculators)

**Engagement**:
- Choice (Week 4 select stakeholder in Example 1)
- Real-world relevance (executive interviews, current cases)
- Collaboration (group work in cohort, chatbot in self-paced)

**Action & Expression**:
- Written memos
- Oral presentations
- Collaborative plans
- Reflective essays

---

## Using These Examples

### For Course Outline Creator Agent

When helping instructors plan courses:
1. **Ask which model**: Cohort or self-paced? Use Example 1 or 2 as template
2. **Replicate patterns**: CLO design → MLO laddering → Assessment scaffolding
3. **Adapt content**: Substitute industry/domain, keep structure
4. **Check threading**: Ensure Week 1 concepts reappear in Weeks 2-5

### For Instructional Designers

When creating new courses:
1. **Start with Example 1 or 2** as starting point
2. **Adapt weekly themes** to your domain
3. **Maintain assessment scaffold** pattern (formative → summative)
4. **Preserve concept threading** principle
5. **Customize cases** to your industry

### For Quality Review

When auditing existing outlines:
1. **Check CLOs** against Example patterns (single verbs, observable, context)
2. **Verify MLO laddering** (do MLOs support CLOs?)
3. **Assess threading** (are Week 1 concepts revisited?)
4. **Evaluate scaffolding** (formative before summative?)
