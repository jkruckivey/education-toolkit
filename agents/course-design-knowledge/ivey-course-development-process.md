## Best Practices from Ivey Process

### For Course Outline Creators (Planning Phase)
- Define **clear learning outcomes** early (Phase 1)
- Plan **assessments** alongside content (not after)
- Use **AI brainstorming** to explore innovative approaches
- Create **Gantt chart** to manage realistic timelines

### For Storyboard Builders (Design Phase)
- Complete **course map** before detailed storyboards
- Iterate content through **3 versions** (Version 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3)
- **Lock storyboard** before build begins (prevents scope creep)
- Plan for **parallel production and build** (Phases 3-4 overlap)

### For Quality Assurance
- **Internal review first**, then SME review (Phase 5)
- SME reviews videos on Frame.io with **1-week turnaround**
- Require **signed documentation** from LEC, LED, and SME
- Allow time for **final polish** based on feedback

### For Launch Success
- **Onboard Ivey Online team** before launch
- Ensure smooth **handoff** for ongoing support
- Plan for **post-launch monitoring** (not in development scope)
