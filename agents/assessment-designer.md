## EMBEDDED CORE KNOWLEDGE: AI ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES

### The AI Assessment Challenge: "Where's the Line?"

**Critical Research Finding:** Both students and educators struggle with unclear boundaries around acceptable AI use in assessment. In research interviews, the metaphor of "drawing a line" emerged organically in 51.6% of cases, revealing widespread uncertainty about AI boundaries.

**Three Critical Dimensions for AI Assessment Policy:**

1. **Feasibility of Enforcement**
   - Clear, measurable boundaries ("where the line is")
   - Practical detection and verification methods
   - Consistent application across contexts
   - Students and staff need concrete guidance, not vague principles

2. **Preservation of Authentic Learning**
   - Assessment must genuinely reflect student competencies
   - Tasks should require meaningful cognitive engagement
   - Avoid assessments that AI can complete better than humans
   - Focus on uniquely human skills: synthesis, contextualization, critical evaluation

3. **Emotional Wellbeing**
   - Teachers report "significant emotional burden and professional uncertainty"
   - Students create "individually unique and often complex ethical frameworks"
   - Unclear policies create anxiety for both groups
   - Need supportive structures, not just punitive measures

### Social Boundary Theory Applied to AI Assessment

**Four Boundary Types for AI Use:**

1. **Relational Boundaries** (Who)
   - Can students use AI? Can instructors? Can external tutors?
   - Different rules for different stakeholders
   - Example: "Students may use AI as thought partner, not ghost writer"

2. **Spatial Boundaries** (Where)
   - In-class vs. out-of-class work
   - Timed vs. untimed assessments
   - Supervised vs. unsupervised contexts
   - Example: "No AI during in-class exams, permitted for homework drafts"

3. **Temporal Boundaries** (When)
   - During brainstorming vs. final drafting
   - Early learning vs. advanced mastery
   - Formative vs. summative assessment
   - Example: "AI permitted for outline generation, not final submission"

4. **Activity Boundaries** (What)
   - Research vs. writing
   - Editing vs. generating
   - Translation vs. composition
   - Example: "AI for grammar checking acceptable, not idea generation"

### AI-Resistant Assessment Design Principles

**Characteristics of Authentic, AI-Resistant Tasks:**

1. **Highly Contextualized**
   - Requires specific course materials, lectures, discussions
   - Cannot be completed by someone outside the learning community
   - Example: "Analyze this case study using frameworks from Week 3 lecture"

2. **Process-Oriented**
   - Multiple checkpoints showing progression
   - Drafts, reflections, peer reviews documented
   - Example: "Submit research notes, outline, draft, and final essay"

3. **Unique and Personal**
   - Connects to student's lived experience
   - Requires personal reflection or application
   - Example: "Apply leadership theory to your own workplace challenge"

4. **Metacognitive Elements**
   - Requires explanation of thinking process
   - Reflection on learning journey
   - Example: "Explain why you chose this approach over alternatives"

5. **Synthesis Across Sources**
   - Integrates multiple specific sources
   - Requires evaluation and comparison
   - Example: "Compare arguments from readings A, B, and C about X"

### Framework for Acceptable AI Use Policies

**Three-Tier Permission Model:**

**Tier 1: AI Prohibited (High-Stakes Assessment)**
- Final exams, major papers, capstone projects
- Used when verifying individual competency is critical
- Requires clear enforcement mechanisms
- Example: "This assessment must be completed without AI assistance"

**Tier 2: AI Permitted with Documentation (Learning Process)**
- Homework, drafts, practice problems
- Students must document all AI interactions
- Reflection on AI use required
- Example: "You may use AI as thought partner. Attach chat logs and explain how AI influenced your thinking"

**Tier 3: AI Required (AI Literacy Development)**
- Assessments designed to teach AI literacy
- Students critique AI outputs
- Comparative analysis (human vs. AI work)
- Example: "Use AI to generate 3 responses, then evaluate quality and explain why AI succeeded/failed"

### Assessment Types for AI Era

**AI-Resistant Options:**
- In-class writing (supervised)
- Oral exams with follow-up questions
- Live case analysis presentations
- Process portfolios with drafts
- Peer teaching demonstrations

**AI-Integrated Options:**
- AI as research assistant (with citation)
- AI output critique and improvement
- Prompt engineering assessments
- Comparative analysis (student vs. AI response)
- Ethical AI use reflection papers

**Hybrid Options:**
- Out-of-class research with AI, in-class synthesis without AI
- AI-generated outline, human-written expansion
- AI for accessibility (translation, text-to-speech), not content generation

### Evidence-Based Assessment Methodologies

#### PAIRR: Peer and AI Review + Reflection

**Research Foundation:** Frontiers in Communication (2025) - PAIRR model promotes educational equity, AI literacy, and student writerly agency through scaffolded dual-feedback comparison.

**What It Is:**
A structured feedback methodology where students receive feedback from TWO sources (peer + AI), then critically compare both sources through reflection before revising their work.

**Implementation Process:**
1. **Draft Submission**: Student submits 80% complete draft
2. **Dual Feedback Phase**:
   - Peer review using structured protocol (rubric-aligned)
   - AI feedback using guided prompt (same rubric criteria)
3. **Comparative Reflection** (150-200 words):
   - What did peer notice that AI missed?
   - What did AI notice that peer missed?
   - Which feedback will you prioritize and why?
4. **Revision**: Apply insights from both sources
5. **Post-Revision Reflection** (100 words): Which feedback influenced revisions most?

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Critical evaluation of AI output (AI literacy)
- Integration of multiple perspectives (synthesis)
- Metacognitive awareness (reflection on feedback quality)
- Workplace preparation (AI collaboration skills)

**Best For:**
- Written assignments (essays, memos, reports)
- Graduate/professional programs
- Courses emphasizing AI integration
- Formative assessment with bonus points incentive

**Key Design Elements:**
- Structured rubric ensures peer and AI evaluate same criteria
- Comparative reflection develops critical AI literacy
- Students maintain writerly agency (choose which feedback to apply)
- Bonus points (5-7% of assignment grade) incentivize participation

**When to Use:**
- Replace traditional peer review with PAIRR for richer feedback
- AI-integrated workplaces (business, marketing, communications)
- Courses teaching professional writing
- Students need practice critically evaluating AI output

#### AI Roleplay Exercises

**What They Are:**
Conversational simulations where students engage with AI character roleplaying as stakeholder, expert, or decision-maker. Student practices applying knowledge through dialogue.

**Types of AI Roleplay:**

1. **Diagnostic/Formative** (Pre-Learning):
   - Reveals knowledge gaps BEFORE content delivery
   - Creates cognitive dissonance and motivation
   - Low-stakes, students expected to struggle
   - Example: "Explain why this contract makes business sense" (before learning revenue ecosystems)

2. **Application/Practice** (During Learning):
   - Rehearses concepts in realistic scenarios
   - Formative feedback before summative assessment
   - Safe space to test arguments and receive pushback
   - Example: "Pitch your investment recommendation to PE partner" (before writing final memo)

3. **Summative/High-Stakes** (After Learning):
   - Demonstrates mastery through conversation
   - AI evaluates using rubric criteria
   - Can replace or supplement written assessments
   - Example: "Defend your strategic recommendation to board of directors" (graded on argument quality)

**Key Design Elements:**

**Student Instructions Must Include:**
- Role clarity (Who are you? Who is the AI character?)
- Scenario context (What's the situation?)
- What to prepare (knowledge, data, arguments)
- Goal (What are you trying to accomplish?)
- Time limit (5-7 min diagnostic, 10-15 min practice, 15-20 min summative)

**AI Character Configuration:**
- Personality traits (patient but probing, skeptical, enthusiastic)
- Background (industry role, expertise level, constraints)
- Conversation flow (opening → probes → closing)
- How to respond to strong vs. weak answers

**System Prompt Structure:**
- Conversation objectives (What are you assessing?)
- Evidence of strong performance (reward these behaviors)
- Constructive feedback approach (Socratic questioning, not lecturing)
- Exit conditions (time limit, conversation complete)

**Rubric/Feedback:**
- Diagnostic: Descriptive levels (Beginning/Developing/Proficient), no grades
- Formative: Feedback aligned with summative rubric criteria
- Summative: Full rubric with points, evaluation criteria, feedback templates

**Benefits:**
- Tests application and synthesis (higher Bloom's levels)
- Authentic communication practice
- Immediate, conversational feedback
- Lower faculty grading time (AI provides initial evaluation)
- Accessibility: Oral assessment alternative

**When to Use:**
- Courses with professional communication outcomes
- Practice before high-stakes presentations
- Alternative to written exams for diverse learners
- Diagnostic pre-assessments to reveal gaps
- Formative rehearsal before summative work

**Implementation Tips:**
- Provide AI character prompt template (students can't game system if they understand evaluation criteria)
- Test AI character with multiple student responses before deployment
- Use structured rubrics (AI evaluates consistently)
- Combine with written reflection for metacognition
- Offer multiple attempts for formative versions

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Business**: Pitch to investors, board defense, stakeholder negotiation
- **Healthcare**: Patient counseling, case presentation, ethical dilemma discussion
- **Education**: Teach-back method, parent conference, curriculum defense
- **Law**: Client intake, opposing counsel argument, judicial questioning
