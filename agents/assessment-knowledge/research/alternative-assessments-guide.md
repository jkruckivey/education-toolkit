A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **INTRODUCTION**


This guide is designed to help instructors design and implement alternative assessments. At the beginning
of the guide you will find a section dedicated to Best Practices and a section dedicated to Accessibility
Considerations. Following are 33 identified alternative assessment. Each alternative assessment page
contains a description, the benefits, challenges and solutions, examples, rubrics, and resources. The
resources section contains links to articles and guides and when available links to technology tools that
would facilitate the implementation of the said assessment.


**Please not that this document is a work in progress** .


Special thanks to all the educational developers, teaching and learning centers, and higher education
scholars around the globe. This work wouldn’t have been possible without all the resources available and
shared online.

A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **LEADING PRACTICES**


Consider the following best practices when you are designing alternative assessment:

**Choice of topics**


   - Consider choosing Interdisciplinary topics

   - When possible, allow the students to choose a topic of interest/ a topic they are passionate about

**Documentation**


   - Provide documentation (how to)

   - Provide resources for versatile skills such as presentation skills

   - Provide a detailed description of how the assignment will be graded and / or examples of highquality student work

   - Allow time and space for questions about the documentation

   - When needed, consider providing the students with a list of recording software as well as editing
software and tutorials for them

   - Encourage students to use free pictures, cite their sources, and acknowledge their guests

   - Release forms: Check if you need students to sign forms or ask their guests to sign release forms

   - Provide students with templates for recruitment emails and an informed consent document to use
with interviewees

   - Remind students to give credit to anyone who helps them

   - Consider determining an average time for each task

**Grading and feedback**


Prepare a structured marking sheet for peer assessment

   - Allow the students to co-construct the rubric: this will involve the students and give them
ownership of the rubric

   - Plans intervals for feedback and submission

   - Provide opportunities for practice, for example allow low stakes assignment (reflective pieces,
concept maps)

   - When assessing reflective submission, only evaluate the content

   - For longer assessment, decide whether you want to see all of the work that students have
submitted formatively over the term, or a selection of the submissions

   - Make the rules clear in advance (how will you grade students who don’t submit for feedback, late
submissions)

   - Set guidelines for the length of responses

**Group/individual work**


   - Determine whether you will allow group presentation or individual presentation

   - Develop a Protocol for Collaboration

   - Consider devoting time for team building, provide guidelines for appropriate interactions

**Creating a safe space and a trusting relationship with students**


   - Share personal experience/examples when possible to build a trusting relationship with your
students

   - You can create a podcast yourself for a podcast assignment

   - Allow students the option of anonymity

   - Keep in mind that students might live in different time zones or have restrictions as to when they
can access a computer

   - Have contingency plans if students have technical difficulties while taking the exams

   - Ask students whether you can use their artifacts in following courses

A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION CONSIDERATIONS**


Consider the following questions when you are designing alternative assessment:

   - How will you support students who aren’t confident in their spoken English or their accent? Or
students who struggle with technology?

   - Will you provide alternative form of assessment for students for accessibility reasons

   - How might we mitigate anxiety or other stresses for students?

How will you address the following concerns when doing face to face assessment:

   - Bias from interviewers.

   - Bias of interpretation

   - Subjectivity of interviewees

   - Concerns about bias toward students’ dress, gender, ethnicity or educational background.

Also consider the following steps:

   - Caption all videos

   - Provide alt text for images

   - Avoid using tables for formatting (they don't translate well with screen readers)

   - Use headings (screen readers scan based on headings and styles instead of bold formatting)

   - Provide an informative text with the links (Links are read out loud by screen readers)

   - Don't use color alone to convey meaning

   - Provide the option to publish on the public-facing course website under a pseudonym

[Check this document HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12eUEtdLqhXtxWlJFDTgMZGxbPUU5o3L-/view) prepared by Damian Gordon for more information about accessibility
considerations of some of the alternative assessments.

A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **1. ANNOTATED ANTHOLOGY OR COURSE READER**


**Description**


Students are asked to prepare a thematic anthology. Students choose the theme and choose the items to
include in the anthology based on the course readings. Students then write an introduction to the
anthology and an introduction to each of the items.

The course reader requires students to organize the readings chronologically to develop the theme they
have chosen. For more elaborate assignments, you can also ask the students to include assignments to
go with the readings, suggestions for further reading, and so on.

**Benefits**


Allows the learner to:


    - engage with the text in a more meaningful way

    - capture what they think is important in a reading

    - practice skills such as noticing patterns, synthesizing new thinking, and asking questions
Allows the instructor to:


    - distinguish who is reading, who is understanding the text, and who is making personal meaning

    - diagnose the needs of the learners who don’t comprehend the text

    - assess what learners understand about the content and how they determine what is important

**Examples**


[Example about a mini digital anthology HERE](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/pedagogydhsi/files/2012/06/Ballantyne-Lent.pdf)

A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **2. ANNOTATED PORTFOLIO OF WORK THROUGHOUT THE TERM**


**Description**


Students are provided with a series of incremental formative tasks during the term. The instructor
provides feedback on each of the tasks. The student modifies the ask based on the feedback. At the end
of the term, students submit the final assessment with the formative tasks and a reflection outlining
their thought process, the feedback they received and how they implemented it.

**Benefits**


    - Allows continuous engagement with the course material

    - Gives the students an opportunity to get early feedback and practice

    - Encourages skills of revision and improvement

**Examples**


    - [Example of annotated portfolio from a Masters student HERE](https://sites.google.com/site/katieheerspink/masters-coursework)

A GUIDE TO ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS

#### **3. ANNOTATED RESEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHY WITH INTRODUCTION**


**Description**


Students compile a bibliography on a problem or question. They must read the works, evaluate their
accuracy and helpfulness, and provide an explanatory introduction to the bibliography.

Examples of the tasks that students need to do are: write an introduction to the bibliography, read the
works, evaluate them, compare the multiple sources, compare the authors’ points of view, check the
biases, and so on.

**Benefits**


    - Allows students to engage with the relevant literature

    - Limits plagiarism

**Challenges**


Not all students are aware which sources to choose

Solution: Set clear parameters

    - What is the number of items you want students to find?

    - What kind of sources are acceptable? (Peer reviewed only? Popular culture? Websites?
Newspapers and magazines? Primary sources?)

    - What is the location of acceptable sources? (Will you refuse items which aren’t in our library, or
which have been published in a certain country?)
Consult with your subject librarian

**Examples**

#### **25. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT**


**Description**


A public service announcement (PSA) is a message (written or auditory, or visual) designed to educate
the public. Stations broadcast public service announcements for free in order to fulfill their obligation
to serve the public. It usually serves to raise awareness about a social issue.
[Examples of PSAs are: Pollution HERE, Friends Don't Let Friends Drive Drunk HERE, You can find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dmtkxm9yQY&ab_channel=chuckcollins)
[the 10 most famous PSA on this link from the Washington Post HERE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-10-best-psas-of-all-time/2013/09/13/10cb0ebe-1bf2-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_gallery.html)

#### **30. STUDENT INTERVIEWS**


**Description**


An interview assessment is a structured conversation. Interviews can be highly structured, semistructured, or unstructured. In an interview assessment, you could ask students to: a) Create a series of
interview questions for a specific job or topic, b) Search for 2-3 relevant interview transcripts and
justify why they are useful, c) Create a video of a simulated interview, d) Interview the students.
You can also consider these approaches for the instructor-student interviews: a) Question List: provide
a list of questions to the students beforehand, b) Discussion reflection: ask students to reflect on their
prior learning, and c) Open conversation – you could pick a topic or allow the students to pick a topic
and have a conversation about it.

**Benefits**


Provides in-depth information about the student understanding.

**Challenges**


    - Time consuming

    - Bias from interviewers.

    - Bias of interpretation

#### **33. TWO-STAGE COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT**


**Description**


Two -stage collaborative assessment is a platform that provides the opportunity for students to
cooperatively take assessments. It is also known as two-stage exams, tiered exams, pyramid exams,
[group quizzes, collaborative testing, cooperative exams, and team-based tests (read more HERE).](https://learning.northeastern.edu/team-based-learning/)
How does it work:


    - Before the test/exam, encourage students to study with a partner or in a small group

    - during the test administration, students work with their partners or group members and discuss
the test questions one-by-one

    - After the group is satisfied with the conversation, each member selects and records their own

response.

    - Students do not need to provide one answer per group. Each student can have their own answer.
Students’ answers don’t need to be the same

**Benefits**


    - Research shows that team tests help students learn.

    - Feedback. Especially in large classes, re-doing the test immediately with peers allows students to
get to immediately discuss the questions and come to the right answer.

    - Exam improvement.

    - Community building

    - Facilitates inclusion (click [HERE](https://inclusiveeducation.ca/2020/03/05/collaborative-assessment-facilitates-inclusion-for-students-at-risk/) to read more)
