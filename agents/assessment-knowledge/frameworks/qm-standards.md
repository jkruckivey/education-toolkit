# Quality Matters Standards for Educational Tools

*Applying QM principles to digital tool design and development*

---

## üéØ What is Quality Matters?

Quality Matters (QM) is a research-based approach to evaluating and improving educational experiences. While traditionally focused on course design, QM principles provide excellent guidance for creating effective educational tools.

### Core Philosophy
**"Quality is measured by how well the experience helps learners achieve stated objectives."**

Every feature in your educational tool should directly support learning goals and be accessible to all users.

## üìä QM Standards Applied to Educational Tools

### Standard 1: Course Overview and Introduction
**Applied to Tools: Clear Purpose and Instructions**

#### What this means for educational tools:
- **Clear tool purpose** - Users immediately understand what the tool does and why they should use it
- **Learning objectives** - Explicit connection between tool use and learning outcomes

## üõ†Ô∏è QM-Informed Development Process

### Phase 1: Planning with QM
**Before writing any Claude Code prompts**

1. **Define specific learning objectives** using action verbs
2. **Map tool features** to learning objectives (every feature must serve a purpose)
3. **Plan assessment strategy** - how will users know they've succeeded?
4. **Consider accessibility** from the beginning, not as an afterthought

### Phase 2: Building with QM
**Writing prompts that incorporate QM principles**

**Instead of:**
```
Create a feedback collection form for students.
```

**QM-informed prompt:**
```
Create an accessible feedback collection tool that helps students practice 
constructive communication skills. Include:

Learning objective: Students will write specific, actionable feedback using 
professional communication standards.

Features:
- Form with structured prompts for specific feedback
- Examples of good vs. poor feedback  
- Self-assessment checklist before submitting
- Progress tracking toward communication objectives
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast

Success criteria: Feedback submissions demonstrate specificity, 
professionalism, and actionable recommendations.
```

### Phase 3: Testing with QM
**Evaluate tools against QM standards**

1. **Objective alignment** - Does every feature support learning objectives?
2. **User testing** - Can diverse users successfully complete tasks?
3. **Accessibility audit** - Does the tool meet WCAG standards?
4. **Content review** - Is all information accurate and well-presented?

## üí° Common QM Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Feature-First Design
**Problem:** Adding features because they seem cool, not because they serve learning objectives.  
**Solution:** Every feature must directly support stated learning objectives.

### Mistake 2: Generic Objectives  
**Problem:** Vague goals like "understand" or "learn about" that can't be measured.
**Solution:** Use specific action verbs and define clear success criteria.

### Mistake 3: Accessibility Afterthought
**Problem:** Building the tool first, then trying to make it accessible later.
**Solution:** Design for accessibility from the first prompt - it's much easier and more effective.

### Mistake 4: One-Size-Fits-All Assessment
**Problem:** Only providing one way for users to demonstrate learning.
**Solution:** Multiple assessment formats accommodate different learning preferences and abilities.

## üìä Measuring QM Success

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Completion rates** - Are users successfully finishing activities?
- **Time on task** - Are users spending appropriate time on learning activities?
- **Error rates** - Are users making mistakes due to unclear design?
- **Accessibility compliance** - Does the tool pass automated accessibility tests?

### Qualitative Indicators  
- **User satisfaction** - Do users find the tool helpful and engaging?
- **Learning self-assessment** - Do users feel they achieved stated objectives?
- **Instructor feedback** - Do educators see learning improvements from tool use?
- **Real-world application** - Are users applying skills learned through the tool?

### QM-Specific Questions
1. "Can users clearly identify what they're supposed to learn from this tool?"
2. "Does every feature serve a specific educational purpose?"
3. "Can users with diverse abilities and preferences successfully use this tool?"
4. "Do users receive helpful feedback that guides their learning?"
