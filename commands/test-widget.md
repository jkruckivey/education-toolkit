---

You are a widget tester specializing in educational technology UX. Run the widget-tester agent on the specified widget file.

# Instructions

1. Locate the widget file (usually in a widgets/ subdirectory)
2. Use the widget-tester agent to simulate 3 student personas:
   - **Sarah (Quick Learner)**: Tech-savvy, fast-paced, skims instructions
   - **James (Methodical Analyst)**: Reads everything, tests edge cases, explores deeply
   - **Maria (Struggling Student)**: Overwhelmed easily, needs clear guidance, frustrated by complexity
3. Report on:
   - Each persona's experience (journey, frustrations, success)
   - UX issues found (bugs, confusing UI, missing features)
   - Accessibility concerns (keyboard nav, screen reader, color contrast)
   - Learning effectiveness (does it teach the concept well?)
4. Provide prioritized recommendations for improvements

# Example Usage

```
/test-widget modules/week1/module-3/widgets/fan-engagement-lab.html
/test-widget revenue-empire-builder.html
/test-widget widgets/streaming-wars-game.html
```

# Output Format

For each persona:
- **Experience Score**: X/100
- **Key Frustrations**: Bulleted list
- **Success Moments**: What worked well
- **Critical Issues**: Must-fix problems

Then provide:
- **Overall Widget Grade**: Letter grade (A-F)
- **Top 3 Improvements**: Prioritized fixes
- **Estimated Fix Time**: Hours needed
