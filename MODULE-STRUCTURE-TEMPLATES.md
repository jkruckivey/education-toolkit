# MODULE STRUCTURE TEMPLATES

## Terminology Guide

**IMPORTANT - Learning Outcome Codes:**
- **Cohort courses** → **WLO** (Week Learning Outcomes): WLO 1.1, WLO 2.1, WLO 2.2
- **Self-paced courses** → **MLO** (Module Learning Outcomes): MLO 1.1, MLO 2.1, MLO 2.2

**Why this matters:** Cohort courses follow a fixed weekly schedule, so outcomes are tied to specific weeks. Self-paced courses allow flexible progression through modules.

**ASK THE USER if format is unclear!** The templates below differ significantly.

## CRITICAL: Course Format Determines Structure

**Before building storyboards, confirm course format:**

**COHORT COURSES:**
- Fixed start/end dates with weekly progression
- Weekly pacing and deadlines
- Synchronous peer interaction possible
- Can use PAIRR methodology (peer + AI feedback)
- Anchor Project with weekly milestones
- **Terminology**: Use "Week 1, Week 2" and "WLO X.X" (Week Learning Outcomes)

**SELF-PACED COURSES:**
- Students work at own speed
- Asynchronous only (NO peer review, NO live sessions)
- Checkpoint-based pacing (no firm deadlines)
- **Final test** instead of anchor project milestone build
- Optional practice activities (not multi-week build)
- Individual assessments only (NO PAIRR)
- **Terminology**: Use "Module 1, Module 2" and "MLO X.X" (Module Learning Outcomes)

### Why This Matters

- PAIRR appears only in cohort courses (Week 2, Module 6)
- Cohorts use weekly deadlines & project checkpoints
- Self-paced uses flexible timing and final test
- Tone and instructional sequencing differ

## Final Project Connection Templates

### COHORT (Anchor Project) - Specific Example:
```markdown
## Element 10: Anchor Project Connection

**Applying This Week's Concepts to Your Team Analysis**

Element 4's revenue model framework (media rights, ticketing, merchandising) directly applies to **Section 3.2 of your anchor project memo**: Revenue Stream Analysis. You'll use the three-category model introduced today to structure your analysis of the Vancouver Canucks' revenue ecosystem.

**Due Friday 11:59 PM ET** - Draft Section 3.2 (400-500 words analyzing media rights, ticketing, and merchandise revenue using Exhibits A and B from today's case). This section will receive peer feedback next week before your final submission.

**Template provided:** Use the Section 3.2 template in your anchor project document (already distributed).
```

### SELF-PACED (Final Project) - Specific Example:
```markdown
## Element 10: Final Project Connection

**Applying This Week's Concepts to Your Analysis**

Element 4's revenue model framework (media rights, ticketing, merchandising) directly applies to **Checkpoint 3 of your final project**: Revenue Stream Analysis. You'll use the three-category model introduced today to structure your analysis of a professional sports organization's revenue ecosystem.

**Checkpoint 3 (when ready)** - Complete your revenue stream analysis (400-500 words) using the framework from today. Review the self-check rubric provided with Checkpoint 3 to ensure your analysis meets expectations before moving to Checkpoint 4.
